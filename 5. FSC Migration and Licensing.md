## FSC Migration Considerations

* We can divide FSC Migrations into 4 Steps
  * Understanding the System Landscape
  * Lightning Readiness
  * Data Migration
  * Understanding the Impact of the Individual Model vs Person Account Model
  
## Understanding the System Landscape

* Understaning the Banking Landscape
* GRP
* Risk Management

* Banking Domain (Where FSC Applies)
  * FSC Started with the Wealth Management and it extended to Customer Centric Retail Banking.
  * Now it moves into Insurance and HouseHold Banking
  
* 2nd Consideration: As-is status of the Customer Org
  * 2 Types
    * Green Field Implementation
    * Brown Field Implementation
      * From Existing Classic Org
        * Could be using Individual Model
        * Could be using Person Account Mode
      * From Lightning Org
        * Could be using Individual Model
        * Could be using Person Account Model

* Migration Needs are to be evaluated under 4 Architecture Domains
* This is really a TOGAF Architecture Lingo 
  * Business Architecture
    * This will need to be a done in all categories of migration in detail. This is the most important aspect of migration to FSC.
  * Application Architecture
    * This will need to be a done in all categories of migration, especially with Integration as FSC is a Pre-built Package.
  * Data Migration
  * Technology Migration
    * This migration is generally managed by Salesforce as it is the SaaS Provider.

### Account Centricity vs Customer Centricity

* Transition from Account Centricity to Customer Centricity
  * Change Management Impact
  * How much of Business Transformation the organization is willing to undertake in given time.

* There is a functional mismatch between traditional retail banking vs future of the retail banking.
* Traditional Retail Banking are Account based and not customer based.
* Banks store Customer information traditionally for compliance and money laundering etc.
* If the customer Portfolio and assets increases, then these customers move from Retail Banking to Wealth Management and in some cases move to Private Banking (Subset of Wealth Management)
* Customer Centricity starts with Wealth Management.
* Wealth Management Systems typically store the information in customer centric way vs account centric way and so implementing FSC to Wealth Management is typically easy than implementing for Retail Banks.
* Most likely the core object of the wealth management is already the customer.
* In case of the Retail Banking Systems the core object is the Bank Account.


### Lightning Readiness

* This is the current and future UI for Salesforce. Lightning was introduced in 2015.
* The org in which FSC can be installed should be on Lightning Platform.
* **FSC Works Only on Lightning**
* Step by Step Process for moving from Classic Org to FSC Lightning
  * Assess
    * This Phase focusses on activities related to assessing existing org, processes, customization, data model fitness, gaps, technical debt, integrations, impact. Buy in from Stakeholders to migrate to FSC
  * Refactor
    * Focus on modifying existing org to prepare intake of FSC Package. Typical activities related to data model changes, lightning UX migration, removal of technial debt. etc.
  * Install 
    * Focus is to install & test FSC Package in remediation Sandbox Org. Activities focus on creating builds that combines remediation code with FSC base install to resolve issues/conflicts 
  * Streamline
    * Streamline use cases, business process to maximize FSC Capability, feature set, partner with BU Stakeholders to streamline for target state.
  * Build
    * Focus on typical Salesforce development activities such as declarative and component based development.
  * Test
    * Regression testing for existing as-is functionality vs new process and new features built. Technical testing ensures that bugs are identified and integrations work.
  * Deploy
    * Activities related to Change Management, Training, Pilot & Go-live activities with communication plan to prepare users.
    
  
### Data Migration

* Understanding System Landscape and Lightning Readiness are pre-requisit steps before starting with Data Migration

#### Data Loading

* This is technically the difficult part of data migration
* **First Set:**  We load Person Acccount, then related Identification Documents, Employment, Education etc.
* **Second Set:** Then we start with Relationship groups, Person Account Relationship to groups etc.
* **Third Set:** Financial Accounts and its related Objects (Cards, Financial Account Transactions, Billing Statements, Financial Holding etc.)
* Continue with remaining object in any sequence.
* Financial Account Transactions is the place we will have large data volume considerations.
* The Higher the power of the ETL Tool, the more mature the use of it. 
* Undestand the Ongoing Synchronization and Application Performance. 
* We need to understand the Load Volumes, Techniques and sequence for each batch.
* Perform load test to optimize load performance based on load test statistics. 
* For each wave, we need to define
  * Object
  * Batch Size
  * API Type
  * Action (Insert, Upsert etc..)
  * Record Count
  * No. of Batches
  * Sequence
  * Storage
* Once the initial load is done, we need to perform on-going synchronization.
* Common Recommendations
  * For Incremental Loads : SOAP API, 200 Batch Size (Use the Largest Batch Size) - This is for objects with large amount of processing.


### Migration from Individual Model vs Person Account Model

* FSC added Person Account in Spring '18. This is the recommended model.
* When moving from Individual Model to Person Account Model, we need to review flows, triggers and workflow rules, components and reports. 
* Keep in mind that the when we enable Person Account, the OWD security is limited. We can either have
  * Controlled by Parent
  * Account and Contact are Private
* Also, unlike Business accounts, Person Accounts cannot have direct relationship with the contact. But we can use **Contacts to Multiple Accounts** to have relationship with Contacts
* App Exchange Packages: Check if 3rd Party AppExchange Products support person-account. 
* For Integrations: We can use Account object to access Person Accounts, Query and update the contact with the person Account. 
* Once Person Account is enabled in Production, it is irreversible. 

### Paths to FSC

* We can classify the paths to 4 different categories
  * New Client Implementing FSC (Green Field)
  * Existing Client Implementing FSC in a New Org
  * Existing Client, implementing FSC in an Existing Org (Brown Field)
  * Clients wants to wait and see, but wants to be ready

#### New Clients Implementing FSC

 * Similar to Sales Cloud Implementation 
 * Focus on data & Process Mapping methods.
 * Prefer and Promote out-of-the-box over customization
 * ETL Best Practices
 * Data Migration Rehearsals & enough time for production migration. Manage expectation
 * Be aware of limitation in current release
 
#### Existing Client Implementing FSC in a New Org

 * Duplication of Application and Data Integration
   * Data Sync Requirements between 2 orgs
   * Leverage middleware for Orchestration and canonicalization
   * S2S / Salesforce Connect
 * Additional Licensing and Infrastructure Cost Associated.
 * Additional Support Needs
 * Data Migration Rehersals & Enough time for Production Migration.
 * User Rollout and Org Decommision
