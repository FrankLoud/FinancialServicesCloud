## FSC Migration Considerations

* We can divide FSC Migrations into 4 Steps
  * Understanding the System Landscape
  * Lightning Readiness
  * Data Migration
  * Understanding the Impact of the Individual Model vs Person Account Model
  
## Understanding the System Landscape

* Understaning the Banking Landscape
* GRP
* Risk Management

* Banking Domain (Where FSC Applies)
  * FSC Started with the Wealth Management and it extended to Customer Centric Retail Banking.
  * Now it moves into Insurance and HouseHold Banking
  
* 2nd Consideration: As-is status of the Customer Org
  * 2 Types
    * Green Field Implementation
    * Brown Field Implementation
      * From Existing Classic Org
        * Could be using Individual Model
        * Could be using Person Account Mode
      * From Lightning Org
        * Could be using Individual Model
        * Could be using Person Account Model

* Migration Needs are to be evaluated under 4 Architecture Domains
* This is really a TOGAF Architecture Lingo 
  * Business Architecture
    * This will need to be a done in all categories of migration in detail. This is the most important aspect of migration to FSC.
  * Application Architecture
    * This will need to be a done in all categories of migration, especially with Integration as FSC is a Pre-built Package.
  * Data Migration
  * Technology Migration
    * This migration is generally managed by Salesforce as it is the SaaS Provider.

### System Landscape 

* Transition from Account Centricity to Customer Centricity
  * Change Management Impact
  * How much of Business Transformation the organization is willing to undertake in given time.

* There is a functional mismatch between traditional retail banking vs future of the retail banking.
* Traditional Retail Banking are Account based and not customer based.
* Banks store Customer information traditionally for compliance and Anti-money laundering.
* If the customer Portfolio and assets increases, then these customers move from Retail Banking to Wealth Management and in some cases move to Private Banking (Subset of Wealth Management)
* Customer Centricity starts with Wealth Management.
* Wealth Management Systems typically store the information in customer centric way vs account centric way and so implementing FSC to Wealth Management is typically easy than implementing for Retail Banks.
* Most likely the core object of the wealth management is already the customer.
* In case of the Retail Banking Systems the core object is the Bank Account.


### Lightning Readiness

* This is the current and future UI for Salesforce. Lightning was introduced in 2015.
* Step by Step Process for moving from Classic Org to FSC Lightning
  * Assess
    * This Phase focusses on activities related to assessing existing org, processes, customization, data model fitness, gaps, technical debt, integrations, impact. Buy in from Stakeholders to migrate to FSC
  * Refactor
    * Focus on modifying existing org to prepare intake of FSC Package. Typical activities related to data model changes, lightning UX migration, removal of technial debt. etc.
  * Install 
    * Focus is to install & test FSC Package in remediation Sandbox Org. Activities focus on creating builds that combines remediation code with FSC base install to resolve issues/conflicts 
  * Streamline
    * Streamline use cases, business process to maximize FSC Capability, feature set, partner with BU Stakeholders to streamline for target state.
  * Build
    * Focus on typical Salesforce development activities such as declarative and component based development.
  * Test
    * Regression testing for existing as-is functionality vs new process and new features built. Technical testing ensures that bugs are identified and integrations work.
  * Deploy
    * Activities related to Change Management, Training, Pilot & Go-live activities with communication plan to prepare users.
