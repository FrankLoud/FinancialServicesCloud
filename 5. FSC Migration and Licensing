* 2nd Consideration: As-is status of the Customer Org
  * 2 Types
    * Green Field Implementation
    * Brown Field Implementation
      * From Existing Classic Org
        * Could be using Individual Model
        * Could be using Person Account Mode
      * From Lightning Org
        * Could be using Individual Model
        * Could be using Person Account Model
